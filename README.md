I used a Graduate Admissions dataset from Kaggle (Graduate Admission 2). Using one
multiple linear regression on the dataset, I found that undergraduate GPA, research background
and undergraduate university ranking are all positively related to the chance of getting admitted
to a graduate school. The findings identify the opportunities for undergraduate students to
shortlist their universities with their profiles.
